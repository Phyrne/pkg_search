# Summary:  A small wrapper script for searching for and installing packages in OpenBSD using pkg_info & pkg_add

# Change IFS from \n to ' ' so that grep will get the right values.

# Query the package database for the provided string and echo a numbered list of results

# Keep the pkg_info output for later use
